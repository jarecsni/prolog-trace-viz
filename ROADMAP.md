## Ideas / Backlog

Ideas that need more exploration before becoming planned features:

- SVG Timeline Visualisation (inline SVG with connection arrows)
- Interactive HTML output with collapsible sections
- Support for more Prolog systems (GNU Prolog, SICStus)
- Performance profiling visualisation (execution time per predicate)
- Diff mode to compare two execution traces
- Export to other formats (SVG, PNG, PDF)
